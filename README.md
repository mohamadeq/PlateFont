A vehicle license plate -as it's defined in Wikipedia- is a metal or plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes.
If you want to build a program that shows license plates, you can use this font-icon to demonstrate high quality license plates which are similar to the real plates.
In this version i have created my country plates, Iran.
